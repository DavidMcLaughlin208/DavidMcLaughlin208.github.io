<h1>Blender 3D</h1>
<h3>Blender is a jack-of-all trades open source 3D modeling program</h3>
<p>There are many autoCAD type programs out there all with various emphases and price points.</p>
<p>Other programs in the same genre as Blender are Maya, 3DS Max, Real Flow, and Houdini.</p>

<h3>Here are a few reasons why someone would choose Blender over these other programs:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>It's Free</li>
	<li>It's open source</li>
	<li>It can do almost anything other paid programs can</li>
	<li>There are many free tutorials and learning resources</li>
</ul>

<h3>Also, there are reasons someone would choose another program over Blender. Here are some downfalls:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Development and feature integration can be slower than other programs</li>
	<li>The user interface is known for being confusing and unintuitive</li>
	<li>There is little user support (aside from other users)</li>
</ul>

<h2>So what can Blender actually do?</h2>
<p><strong>So many things!!</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>3D Modeling</li>
	<li>Armature Rigging & Animation</li>
	<li>Stylized or Physically Based Rendering</li>
	<li>Material Nodes</li>
	<li>Procedural Textures</li>
	<li>Camera Tracking</li>
	<li>Physics Simulations
		<ul>
			<li>Rigidbody</li>
			<li>Softbody</li>
			<li>Cloth</li>
			<li>Fluid</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Countless user made add-ons to provide more functionality</li>
</ul>
