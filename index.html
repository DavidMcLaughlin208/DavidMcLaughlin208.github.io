<h3>Blender is a jack-of-all trades open source 3D modeling program</h3>
<p>There are many autoCAD type programs out there all with various emphases and price points.</p>
<p>Other programs in the same genre as Blender are Maya, 3DS Max, Real Flow, and Houdini.</p>

<h3>Here are a few reasons why someone would choose Blender over these other programs:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>It's Free</li>
	<li>It's open source</li>
	<li>It can do almost anything other paid programs can</li>
	<li>There are many free tutorials and learning resources</li>
</ul>

<h3>Also, there are reasons someone would choose another program over Blender. Here are some downfalls:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Development and feature integration can be slower than other programs</li>
	<li>The user interface is known for being confusing and unintuitive</li>
	<li>There is little user support (aside from other users)</li>
</ul>

<h2>So what can Blender actually do?</h2>
<p><strong>So many things!!</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>3D Modeling</li>
	<li>Armature Rigging & Animation</li>
	<li>Stylized or Physically Based Rendering</li>
	<li>Material Nodes</li>
	<li>Procedural Textures</li>
	<li>Camera Tracking</li>
	<li>Physics Simulations
		<ul>
			<li>Rigidbody</li>
			<li>Softbody</li>
			<li>Cloth</li>
			<li>Fluid</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Countless user made add-ons to provide more functionality</li>
</ul>

<h2>Blender is open source</h2>

<p>Blender is open source and so while there is always at least one dedicated, paid (by donation) employee, anyone can contribute. One of the ways Blender has made this easy is by being able to write scripts in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> using the <a href="https://www.blender.org/api/blender_python_api_2_78a_release/">Blender API</a> to write scripts to perform simple to complex tasks.<p>

<p>On <strong>GitHub</strong> people will create repositories for the add-ons they have created. You simply need to download the file they indicate and tell Blender where to access the add-on.</p>

<p>Follow this <a href="https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=Blender+3D&s=stars&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93">link</a> to view a GitHub search for Blender 3D to see an array of community made blender add-ons.</p>

<p>Here is the Blender 3D offical <a href="https://www.blender.org/">website</a></p>
<p>Some good aspects of the this webiste are that it is responsive, it implements paralax scrolling and immediately presents the user with all information necessary.</p>

<p>As you resize the window used to view the Blender website, the page responds by respacing text and images to more appropriately fill the space. As you scroll down the page the artwork in the background scrolls down at a slower rate than the rest of the information; giving the impression of depth. Upon the page loading the user is presented with basic information about Blender and also provided 7 links with clear titles to help the user navigate the site to find the more specific information they need.</p>
